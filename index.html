        <p>My Precious One,</p>
        <p>
        From the moment our paths first crossed, my soul has known a singular truth: it will always be you. Regardless of where life may lead or what time may bring, my heart refuses any other name. In my mind, there is only you. My eyes blink only to hold the image of your hazel gaze a moment longer; my lips part only to whisper your name into the quiet of my blue days.
        </p>
        <p>
        You see, ever since my pen learned to form your name, my goal was never to be a perfect poet, but simply to give voice to the words that cling within the hollow of my heart—words that tremble on my tongue but refuse to be spoken. I have always found myself speechless before you, lost in a void that ached to be filled. Until I discovered my way: to write to you.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each time I pour my soul onto the page for you, I see a spark. That void begins to glow, illuminated by all the unspoken feelings and silent admirations I could never utter. It is a light that guides my hand and gives purpose to my silence.
        </p>
        <p>
        Perhaps in this life, our stars are not aligned to meet as I dream. And so, I will pray. I will pray for the universe to grant us another chance, in another lifetime, that I might love you as you deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
        You are doing such a magnificent job. I have always said you possess a magic touch—an alchemy that turns all you do into gold. Never stop learning, never stop creating. My heart is so profoundly proud of the person you are.
        </p>
        <p>
        Always, endlessly proud of you,<br>
        The Dreamer
